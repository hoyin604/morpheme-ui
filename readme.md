ui lib for developer
====================

now problem:
- ui will be change between different view in a vary random usage case e.g.:
  - simple text link @mobile but multi-level hover menu @desktop
  - simple one-by-one photo @mobile but gallery ui @desktop (or reverse)
  - draggable gallery @mobile but nav button ui @desktop

now solution:
- complicate js widget with responsive capability but they can only turn no/off the whole thing. they cannot switch between different widget.
